- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.
- When generating a new blog post in this project:
  - Use the correct front matter format: include `layout`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `categories`, and `excerpt_separator`.
  - Place the new post in the appropriate `_posts/YYYY/` folder, using the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` with zero-padded month and day (e.g., `2025-07-26` not `2025-7-26`).
  - Write a long, SEO-friendly summary in the `description` field that clearly explains the post's topic and value.
  - Use relevant tags and categories that already exist in the project. Ask for confirmation before using new tags or categories.
  - Use `<!--more-->` as the excerpt separator after the introductory paragraph.
  - Follow the writing style and structure of previous posts for consistency.
  - When adding backlinks to previous posts, use the correct Jekyll/Liquid link style (e.g., `{% post_url YYYY/MM-DD-title %}`) instead of hardcoded URLs.
  - If the post is a new addition to an existing post series, add a final section inviting readers to visit the tag page for that series to explore related posts. For example, for HttpPlatformHandler-related posts, add a note like: "To explore more on this topic, check out all posts tagged [HttpPlatformHandler]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/httpplatformhandler/)."
  - Use the correct Liquid syntax for links, e.g., `[link text]({{ site.baseurl }}/path/to/resource/)` instead of hardcoded URLs for tags and categories.
  - Use clean and compact Markdown syntax:
    - Use ATX-style headings (`##` for main heading, `###` for subheadings, etc.) with a space after the hash marks. Do not use single hash (`#`) headings due to Jekyll theme requirements.
    - Ensure proper spacing between paragraphs, headings, and lists (one blank line).
    - Use fenced code blocks with language specifiers (`csharp, `xml, etc.) for better syntax highlighting.
    - Keep line lengths reasonable and use line breaks appropriately for readability in the source.
    - Use reference-style links for cleaner text when there are multiple links to the same source.
