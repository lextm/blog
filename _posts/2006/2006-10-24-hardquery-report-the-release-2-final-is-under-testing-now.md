(CSDN Oct 24, 2006)

I have stopped adding new features into the code base now. Yes, it is under testing now. I wish I could locate and fix all bugs. After adding so many features and refactorings, I am not sure whether bugs are created. As a result, you have to wait for about a week and more because this time, I am gonna do more tests than ever.

However, since I find something unpleasant with NUnit, I will do most of work manually. It is really hard. I wish I could find a solution soon.

Stay tuned.
