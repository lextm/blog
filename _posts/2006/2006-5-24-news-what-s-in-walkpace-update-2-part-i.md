(CSDN May 24, 2006)

A few changes take time.
<!--more-->

1. Most LeXDK staff changes. There is no more BeWise.Common. It is merged with Lextm.LeXDK.Base.Neutral and .BDS. Many type names are changed to remove some phrase like ota.
1. Some type names are changed to indicate its true usage.
1. SharpBuilderTools Plus is almost ready.
1. A Tip of the day Form.

Maybe it will come in June because now I am too busy.

The features described in this piece can be found in Latest Builds. The installer in 20060524 is Update Candidate 1.
