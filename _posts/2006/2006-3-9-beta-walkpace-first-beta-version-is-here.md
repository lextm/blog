This is a real beta version shipped with fewer files in order to reduce size of installer.

Install it to where you installed CBC 2 before. (You must have CBC stable version installed.)

Main features:

1. C#Builder Goodies' Doc Preview function ported. (Default shortcut is Alt+Q.)
1. Easy to configure shortcuts now with an added menu item.
1. Bundled JCF version is now 2.21.
