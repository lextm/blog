(CSDN July 19, 2006)

I would like to know what Code Beautifier Collection users want to see in the next release of HardQuery.
<!--more-->

I have made some reports on my plan, but I think it should be better if you tell me what you like.

I will read your requests and decide what I could do, and finally make a clearer road map for HardQuery.

Also, it can let me know how many people actually use this tool. I see the number of downloads in Borland Developer Network, 2ccc.com, and GForge homepage, but could it be true that so many people use it? What a surprise.
