#15 (http://matrix.oss.org.cn/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=15&group_id=39&atid=257 ) bug is found and fixed right now, and I provide a hotfix here.

It is not an installer because only Utilities Plus should be updated.

The hotfix is for N3 Update 1 RC 5 users, but older versions of N3 Update 1 RCs can use it, too.

Unzip the file and replace the exe file on your PC with the extracted file. You'd better keep a backup of the old file.

This hotfix will be included in RC 6.
