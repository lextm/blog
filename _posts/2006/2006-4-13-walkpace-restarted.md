I have to rebuild the setup in order to add Plus Pack I inside.

Yes, the version now in Borland Developer Network
http://cc.borland.com/item.aspx?id=23950
is the full version of CBC 2.5 + Plus Pack I.

That is not quite big indeed.

If you have not install the Plus Pack yourself, you might install this full version.
