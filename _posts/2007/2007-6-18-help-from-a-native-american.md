title: Help from a Native American
---
In my project at work (PAW) a lot of strings must be standardized. However even after a lot of discussions we found out the terms were not easy to understand.

My team lead suggested we ask for help from other teams, that was how I set up a special meeting with a native American. Wonderful, with his help I can finally settle down on the strings.

It is said that during the SVT process, the strings will be reviewed again. Wish the SVT guys provide me more tips then.
