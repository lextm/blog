When I released 5.3.3 I thought there was no need to update it again. Yes, I cannot add new features back easily. However, I can port back bug fixes.

Therefore, stay tuned, my dear HardQuery users. I will try my best to deliver a bug fix Update 4 in November.

The only issue is that I can fix the source code easily but I am not sure whether I can build it on Windows Vista right now. I will have a try.
