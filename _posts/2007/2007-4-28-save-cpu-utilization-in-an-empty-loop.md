title: Save CPU Utilization In An Empty Loop
---
Sometimes you need to kill some time by running an empty `for` or `while` loop. The only problem is that the CPU utilization will soon reach 100% for a single core CPU or 50% for a duel-core. Oh, my Goodness, it is horrible.

How to solve the problem and protect your/and your users' CPU? A simple walk around is there. Just write `Thread.Sleep(??);` inside the loop. In my case, I let it sleep for 500-ms. In this way, the utilization can be reduced to a quite small number.
