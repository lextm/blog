.NET 3.5 introduces a JSON formatter. So I am considering giving up Yaowi's XmlSerializer and XmlDeserializer some time later.

I know this may break compatibility. So I will do that only if .NET 3.5 becomes really popular. This depends on CodeGear RAD Studio.

If RAD Studio requires a .NET 3.5 installation, you can then see CBC switches to a JSON based setting file format.
