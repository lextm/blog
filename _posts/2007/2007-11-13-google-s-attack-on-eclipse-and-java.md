title: Google's Attack on Eclipse and Java
---
I believe Eclipse is a great IDE and platform. And Java is a nice programming language. But IBM and SUN seem to be dominant, which may badly impact on innovations in certain aspects.

Now comes Google's attack. You can program in Eclipse with Java, but compile to so-called Dalvik bytecode (this is a wonderful idea MSFT tried a few years ago in Visual J++/J#). Then your applications can run on Dalvik VM for the Android mobile platform. I fully understand why Google gives up J2ME and happy to see developers can continue using Java code though compiled a bit different. Wait and see how SUN will revenge and fight for its JME platform.

Google's innovations always come in an unexpected way. But they are nice, aren't they?
