title: Viruses From U Disk
---
A U Disk from a team member filled my hard drive with viruses. And now I have to reboot to Safe Mode to remove them.

Yep, never double click on the U Disk icon in My Computer. Use Windows Browser is much safer.

Also, remember to disconnect to Internet ASAP when you found any virus. In this way, you can prevent further harms. Some virus can download more of them from Internet in seconds.

Wish the Anti-Virus process finish soon. And yep, it has finished.
