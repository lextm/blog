title: TamTam SVN SCC is Now Available
---
I tried TamTam CVS SCC once. It was great. Now the SVN version is available (after about two months). I love it very much though it is still in Beta. Feel good.

The only problem you may face is that your SVN version is too old. This SCC requires SVN 1.4.3 (I am using 1.4.4). Remember to update you SVN if any unexpected bug occurs.

Thank you, David Levinson, for creating so many interesting tools.

(Updated: Now I am using SVN for my open source project Code Beautifier Collection hosted on Google Code. However, TamTam is not my choice for the client. TortoiseSVN delivers a better experience. SharpDevelop provides me a perfect way to maintain CBC by its integration with TortoiseSVN.)
