I modified CBC installer heavily in the GrapeVine process. And now this installer does more tasks than HardQuery ones. For example, a significant feature is that it will exit when CodeGear RAD Studio is not installed or critical Updates are not there. In this way, I can ensure that CBC works fine but this prevents some developers from consuming my assemblies.

I may change the behaviour a little bit in 6.0 Final. Maybe a confirmation dialogue is better. Stay tuned.
