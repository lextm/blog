title: Vista SP1 Performance

I was expecting Vista SP1 and had installed SP1 RC as soon as it was available. But I did not see any significant improvement. Today I saw a piece of news on CSDN.net that Vista SP1 RC performs even worse then RTM in some aspects. OMG, terrible!

Should I ask for a refund?
