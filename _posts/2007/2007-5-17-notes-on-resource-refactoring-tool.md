title: Notes on Resource Refactoring Tool
---
I have been using Resource Refactoring Tool for a long time (with ResEx). However, on a Simplified Chinese Windows, the font problem prevents part of the dialog from correctly showing. (This picture was taken from an English version of Windows.)

As a result, I have to modify the source code myself and build a patched version. I have uploaded the patch here. If you meet similar problems, you can try the patch.
