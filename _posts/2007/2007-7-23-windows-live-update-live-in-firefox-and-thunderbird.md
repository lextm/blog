title: 'Windows Live Update: Live in Firefox and Thunderbird'
---
For a long time Windows Live Spaces of my friends cannot be viewed both in Firefox 3a and Thunderbird 2. I have been tired of switching to IE until today Windows Live starts a special update.

I do not like the new look, a Vista clone style in blue (I rather pick up black personally). However, I appreciate that the page source code is corrected and now feasible to feed Firefox and Thunderbird.

Keep going, Live guys.

BTW, wish I can export my Windows Live Writer settings to another computer in a later version of WLW.
