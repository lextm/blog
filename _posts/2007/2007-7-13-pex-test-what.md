Microsoft Research has a project named Pex. Yep, when I tried to build QuickGraph, a CodePlex project I found a reference named Microsoft.Pex.Framework.

According to GuickGraph's author's blog, features of this new test framework is very amazing. Wish it could be made public soon.

BTW, QuickGraph is a nice project. Maybe I will use in my project later.
