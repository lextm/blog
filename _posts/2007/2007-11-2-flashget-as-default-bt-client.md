title: FlashGet As Default BT Client
---
Just a notice. I removed Azureus and now turned FlashGet to be the default BT Client. Why? Because Azureus only connects to one of the trackers in torrent files, the download rate is always low unless there are lots of seeds on this one tracker.

I gave up BitComet in the past because it does not support Windows Vista well, and now Azureus for speed. FlashGet, please do a nice job for me!
