Window Clipping designed by Kenny Kerr is the tool I use every day to get a screen shot. However, today after updating to 2.0, I found some limitations of usage besides bugfixes.

Another free tool is now switching to shareware.

Luckily I do not need the advanced features right now. But I really wish it is free for ever.
