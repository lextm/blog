title: Vista Extras From Stardock
---
Why you install Windows Vista? Most people buy it want to enjoy the beautiful UI. But in fact you can do more than that. A great company Stardock offers you more customization options for free.

1. CursorXP
1. ObjectDock
1. LogonStudio Vista
1. DeskScape (only can be used on Vista Ultimate)

These free pieces can enhanced your experience. And you can always find more themes at WinCustomize.com.

Even if you are using Windows XP right now, you can try the first three pieces. And BootSkin is also nice on Windows XP (Windows Vista support is not yet announced).

Cannot believe Vista can be even more beautiful now.
