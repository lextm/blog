Finally we see ECO moves to Visual Studio. This is a nice shift. Although it will continue support to Delphi, it lands on a new planet.

If you migrate from C#Builder to Visual C# lately and miss ECO a lot, participate in this field test to meet ECO again. I believe you won't be disappointed.

There is already lots of ORM frameworks in .NET. And let's see who will survive in the next few years. My guess is that LINQ to SQL, NHibernate, and ECO might be dominant.

(Updated: As Jonas pointed out, ECO for VS RTM is now available. What's more? It has a free edition [even for commercial applications]. Wonderful.)
