title: Windows Live Writer Plugins I Use
---
Windows Live Writer is a good pal for bloggers. As with some small plugins you could enjoy yourself more.

The following are plugins I use,

1. Code Snippet, which provides professional formatting of your code. You can see what code I published in posts with Code Snippet.
1. Insert a Smiley, which allows you add Yahoo! and Windows Live Spaces smiley into your blog. I am not a Smiley addict, so you see I use it sometimes, not always.

Yes, I'd like to try some others some time. What plugins do you use? You may leave a comment.
