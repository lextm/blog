title: So Many Modeling Tools
---
I used Together, ROSE, and ModelMaker before. However, now I find Visual Paradigm, Apollo, and Poseidon. What a wonderful world!

BTW, there must be something I missed. Please tell me what modeling tool you are using.

In fact, most tools are for Java. C# or C++ support is not that popular as I expected.
