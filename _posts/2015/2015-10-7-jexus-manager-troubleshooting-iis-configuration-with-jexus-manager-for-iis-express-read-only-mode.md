There are several issues with IIS Manager that you might not be able to use it to troubleshoot IIS configuration issues,

* IIS Manager strictly requires administrator permissions.
* Some file errors will trigger an error dialog (or 500.19 error page) that tells nothing useful.

So time for Jexus Manager ðŸ¤“ and now you can run it as a normal user to navigate the settings, and its exception dialog provides the same or even better error message when an error is detected.

Remember that Jexus Manager also features other unique pages, such as the server side HTTP API view. So, you can learn IIS/HTTP.sys settings easier than ever.
