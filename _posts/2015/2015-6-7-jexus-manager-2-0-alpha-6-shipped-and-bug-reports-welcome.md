After several weeks of hard work, I am glad to announce the immediate availability of Jexus Manager for IIS Express 2.0 Alpha 6.
<!--more-->

This version focuses on supporting site/server level settings, and now the following categories start to work just like IIS Manager,

* Authentication
* Compression
* Default Document
* Error Pages
* HTTP Response Headers
* IP Address and Domain Restrictions
* Logging
* Request Filtering (only hidden segments so far)
* URL Rewrite (only blank rule in inbound rule)
* Server Certificates (server node only, and elevated only)

Most of the foundational work has been done, and from this version on this project will enter Beta phase. Bug reports are welcome at
