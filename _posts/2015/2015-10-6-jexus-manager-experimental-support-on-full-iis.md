If you run the latest build of Jexus Manager for IIS Express Beta 2 as administrator, you might notice an extra node listed in the Connections panel. By double clicking this node, the configuration of full IIS on this machine is displayed.

Currently, the full IIS support is experimental and provided just for reviewing settings. I have enforced a read only mode, where all changes made will trigger exceptions. Full read-write support might come in 3.0 release.

Stay tuned.
