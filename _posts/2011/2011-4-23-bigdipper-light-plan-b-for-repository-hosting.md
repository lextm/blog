We just started to enjoy some of the benefits of switching to Mercurial,

* We won't cry out when the repository on CodePlex is corrupt, as my local one is still healthy. If you have cloned one copy, you can verify its health by running `hg verify` at a command prompt.
* The development is still active as I can use my local one to store new change sets.
* (Most important) We can easily find another place to host the repository so that all collaboration can be resumed.

Now we have Plan B for our repository. Before CodePlex fixes our repository there, we will use Google Code temporarily.

Please continue to visit our CodePlex home page for all other information (discussion board, issue tracker, and wiki).
