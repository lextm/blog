A critical bug was discovered recently and I have to admit this is a "too bad" one.

It simply means that #SNMP generates wrong bytes for many and many negative values, and that can lead to disastrous effects.

The fix is so simple so that I will try to publish new packages as soon as possible (6.1.1 and 7.0 Beta 2).

Besides, I cannot push new changesets to CodePlex again, and we have to resort to Google Code again. Make sure that you have bookmarked the backup site link,

Stay tuned.
