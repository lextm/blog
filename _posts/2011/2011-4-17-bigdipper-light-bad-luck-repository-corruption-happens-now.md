If you currently try to clone our repository and experienced errors, please come back later. I am working with CodePlex support now and hope we can recover the repository in the coming days (or weeks).

Luckily my local Mercurial repository is still healthy, so I have exported source code packages for both HoneyCell Refresh (6.1) and BigDipper (7.0) Beta 1 and uploaded them to the download pages already.
