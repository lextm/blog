I just noticed this project on CodePlex, which provides PHP support in IIS Manager.

I was wondering who created such an amazing thing, and finally found out that the coordinator is a Microsoft employee. How many out of its developers are from Microsoft :)

If you use PHP on Windows Server 2008/IIS 7.0, or Windows Server 2008 R2/IIS 7.5, you must check out this nice tool.
