As you may know, the Mercurial repository for #SNMP on CodePlex became corrupt a long time ago. CodePlex guys tried to restore it once, but it happened again.

So I am wondering if CodePlex would like to support Mercurial as much as Team Foundation Server, as I have sent them emails for several times, and recently even no reply from them.

I fully understand that Microsoft is not dedicated to open source like it advertised, and a lot of nice guys have left CodePlex in the past few months, but this site is not yet shut down as GotDotNet, so please help resolve existing issues, guys.
