title: Binding Diagnostics for IIS and IIS Express Users

The complexity of IIS makes it difficult to learn (nginx and Apache are not exceptionally easy either). So many web developers (ASP.NET or not) can find it hard to understand certain concepts, and such might lead to the configuration failing to meet their desires.

I already discussed HTTPS configuration, and how Jexus Manager [SSL Diagnostics]({% post_url 2015/2015-11-12-jexus-manager-built-in-ssl-diagnostics-for-iis-and-iis-express %}) might help them out. And also [Visual Studio Project Diagnostics]({% post_url 2017/2017-6-18-jexus-manager-recent-changes %}), a tool to sync project settings and site configuration.

Today, I am happy to announce another diagnostics tool for site bindings, aka Binding Diagnostics.

So, a new button "Diagnostics" has been added to the Site Bindings dialog, leading you to the Diagnostics dialog itself,

The report generated by this tool is still preliminary today, and focus purely on IP v4 related information.

So next time when your web site cannot be accessed locally or externally, hope this tool save you a few minutes.
