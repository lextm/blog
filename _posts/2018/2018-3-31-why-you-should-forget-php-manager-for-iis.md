title: Please Forget PHP Manager 1.x for IIS And Welcome PHP Manager 2.0 for IIS
---
PHP on IIS was something Microsoft promoted with lots of efforts. Tools like PHP Manager for IIS do help attract users. Even I [wrote about it]({% post_url 2011/2011-1-29-product-review-php-manager-for-iis %}) in 2011. However, time flies, and it is now time to say goodbye to it and let it die peacefully. Why?

- Its original developer(s) abandoned the project on CodePlex.
- CodePlex was archived earlier this year, so was the homepage of PHP Manager.
- Nobody picks it up nor makes a trustable fork yet.
- The source code and installer does not work with latest IIS, such as IIS 10.
