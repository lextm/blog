I just released Beta 2 for our 6.0 release.

Note that #SNMP repository has been migrated from Team Foundation Server to Mercurial for a few weeks. You will need to use a client such as TortoiseHg to check out latest change sets.

I am preparing the release notes document now and hope to release the final in a few weeks.

Stay tuned.
