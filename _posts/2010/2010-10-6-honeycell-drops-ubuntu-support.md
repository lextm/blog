Last time we tested #SNMP 5 on openSUSE, but this time I use Ubuntu 10.10 Beta to test out #SNMP 6.

Of course, we can see Mono is packaged differently on the two distributions. As a result, I have updated the readme document to mark what extra steps are necessary to make #SNMP compilable.

I think in the next few months, Ubuntu will be my primary Linux distro to test out #SNMP.

Well, Ubuntu 10.10 is going to be released in a few days.
