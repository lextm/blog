I have been using mail to blogger for a while as blogger.com has been blocked for the reason you know. However, I found it hard to embed images.

Now I found Flickr Blog this feature, and blog posts can now be authored easily via flickr.com. I still search for a way to blog about several images in one post. Is it possible?
