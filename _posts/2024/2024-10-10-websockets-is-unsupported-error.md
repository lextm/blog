title: "The History Behind 'WebSockets is Unsupported' Error in ASP.NET"
---
Two weeks ago [I was answering a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79030952/asp-net-4-8-exception-message-websockets-is-unsupported-in-the-current-applica/79041024#79041024) and noticed that the question was not the first time someone encountered the error message "WebSockets is unsupported in the current application configuration." Even [when this was reported to Microsoft developers via GitHub in 2016](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/issues/3699), no one investigated it further. So, I decided to dig deeper, and figured out some interesting history behind this error message.

## The Error Message

It should be very rare that you see this error message in your ASP.NET application. The error message is,

``` text
Exception information: 
    Exception type: InvalidOperationException 
    Exception message: WebSockets is unsupported in the current application configuration. To enable this, set the following configuration switch in Web.config:

<system.web>
  <httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5" />
</system.web>
```
People might be confused by the error message, as it suggests that you should set the `targetFramework` attribute to `4.5` in the `<httpRuntime>` element, even when you are using .NET 4.8. Why the hint in that the error message is not accurate?

## The History

ASP.NET 4.5 was a significant release, as it introduced a lot of new features, including the support for WebSockets. In a similar time frame, Microsoft also introduced WebSocket support in IIS 8.0. Therefore, if you are a long time ASP.NET developer, you have a lot to catch up with.

Things got more complicated if you ever use compatibility mode in your application. The compatibility mode is a feature that allows you to run your application in a lower version of the .NET Framework, even when you are using a higher version. This is useful when you have a legacy application that you cannot upgrade to the latest version of the .NET Framework. For example,

``` xml
<system.web>
  <httpRuntime targetFramework="4.0" />
  <compilation targetFramework="4.0" />
</system.web>
```

This configuration tells ASP.NET to run your application in .NET 4.0 mode, even when you are using .NET 4.5 (or a newer version like 4.8). This is a common practice in many enterprises, as they have a lot of legacy applications that cannot be upgraded easily.

Therefore, when you try to use WebSockets in your application, ASP.NET will check the `targetFramework` attribute in the `<httpRuntime>` element. If it is not set to `4.5`, it will throw the error message "WebSockets is unsupported in the current application configuration." While this might be clear to developers who migrated to .NET Framework 4.5 a long time ago, it is not so clear to developers who are new to ASP.NET and start with .NET Framework 4.6 and above.

## Solution

Well, the solution is simple.

You might just set the `targetFramework` attribute to `4.5` in the `<httpRuntime>` element in your `Web.config` file. For example,

``` xml
<system.web>
  <httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5" />
  <compilation targetFramework="4.5" />
</system.web>
```

But wait, if you are using .NET Framework 4.6 and above, you should set it to the exact version instead.

``` xml
<system.web>
  <httpRuntime targetFramework="4.6" />
  <compilation targetFramework="4.6" />
</system.web>
```

This should solve the error message, and you can continue to use WebSockets in your ASP.NET application.

## Side Notes

Should Microsoft update the error message to reflect the current version of the .NET Framework? I think so. But it is not a big deal as long as someone can figure out the solution quickly. And now you know the history behind this error message.

Well, GitHub search pointed out that [this issue was first reported and resolved in 2013](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/issues/1315). The lesser frequent an issue is, the more likely it will be forgotten.
