Well, for the first time I want to spend more time on packaging the binaries. Here are the list,

1. This time we will ship MS Help v2 version of class references besides HTML Help version.
1. This time we will ship command line versions of tools. Thank Mono for Mono.Options.
1. This time we will ship an MIB compiler. Though it is simple and hard to use, I must confess that we make some progress.

At this moment, I am not quite sure if there will be other items to add. We will see. :)
