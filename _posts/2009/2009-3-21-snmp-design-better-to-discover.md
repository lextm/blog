You may notice that I just closed two work items, 3816 and 3916. The fix is a new component named Discoverer. Therefore, old interfaces to query agents in the same network are obsolete.

Seems that after releasing 2.0 we shall have a lot of code to be cleaned up. It's a good evidence to show that we have done a lot till now. Stay tuned.
