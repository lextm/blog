Just started to dig on Linux/Mono side, as the changes we made on the 8.0 way are so huge. In a few minutes, a serious problem was found,

Not sure how long it will take to have this issue resolved, but it makes our Linux support bit of tough. However, more issues may be ahead, as I am not sure whether SharpDevelop text editor works fine on Mono. In the coming days I will test more on Mono side and report more issues to Mono guys.

Stay tuned.
