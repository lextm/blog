Due to the following reasons, I just converted the repository from Mercurial to Git and host it on GitHub,

* Git enjoys the first class support in most IDE and OS.
* GitHub is more popular than Google Code or CodePlex, and it has code search.
* TortoiseGit is much more convenient to use now.
* MonoDevelop does not have Mercurial support.
* â€¦

From now on, new change sets will only appear on the GitHub page,
