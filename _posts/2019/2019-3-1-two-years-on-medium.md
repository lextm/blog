title: Two Years on Medium
---
I decided to give up my self hosting WordPress and switched to Medium in 2017. It also was the time that I moved from Shanghai to Montreal. While other people decided to move away from Medium, I still love the platform.

* It is relatively simple to maintain (not my task in most cases).
* Markdown style authoring keeps things simple (though I have learned new tricks from time to time).
* I started to take more photos and use them for posts.

Of course, there are sacrifices like I lost the revenue from advertisements, but nothing can be perfect.

Thanks for all the readers, and hope you find the posts useful. I guess you do, as the monthly view number of February 2019 is tripled from March 2017.

Stay tuned.
