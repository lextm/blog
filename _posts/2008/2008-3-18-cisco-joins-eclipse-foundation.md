Just saw the news that Cisco has joined Eclipse Foundation. Good news. And it is not surprised to know the day has come.

As a Software Developer working in a Cisco company, I just saw an internal tool built with Eclipse RCP last month. And have to say it is wonderful.

So, let us keep an eye on the Tigerstrip sub project to see what's going on there in April.
