Because of a discussion session, I suddenly found a critical bug in #SNMP library. Therefore, a new Work Item is added and I am going to work it out before releasing the UnicornHorn Refresh.

I am not sure if there is a lot to be fixed but hope that I can resolve all this weekend. Stay tuned.

BTW, brianb, thank you for reporting this bug.
