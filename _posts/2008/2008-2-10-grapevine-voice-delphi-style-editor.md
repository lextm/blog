When I published 6.0 on CodeGear Code Central, I put "Customize Your Unique Style" in the title. That is because from this version on, Delphi developers can customize coding style in CBC.

1. Click LeXtudio | Options | Preferences to launch this dialogue.
1. Click Configure button. You can customize the coding style here.

If you were a JCF user before you would feel familiar because the dialogue is just the same.

The problem here is that you cannot preview the style immediately but I would try my best to find a solution later.
