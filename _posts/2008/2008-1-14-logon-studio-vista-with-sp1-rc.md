title: Logon Studio Vista with SP1 RC
---
I have installed Vista SP1 RC. Even though no significant improvements I see, I think I should not remove it until SP1 RTM is released.

The only issue right now is that my Logon Studio Vista installation was broken by SP1 RC installer. Luckily to fix it, a reinstall is enough.

And now I switch to this NFS logon screen. Cool!
