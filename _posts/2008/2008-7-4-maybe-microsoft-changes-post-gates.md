title: Maybe Microsoft Changes Post-Gates
---
When I wrote [this post]({% post_url 2008/2008-6-6-sandcastle-puzzle-source-code-closed %}), I was upset. And I never knew that Microsoft would change, after Bill Gates' retirement.

Now, Sandcastle is back to CodePlex, WITH SOURCE CODE.

And I think I can see Sandcastle inside SharpDevelop 3.0 soon.
