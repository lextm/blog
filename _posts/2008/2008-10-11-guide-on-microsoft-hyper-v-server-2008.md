Because Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 is a free hyper-visor, you may find it hard to search for related materials. I felt the same way but luckily I came across this post by Ben . It is so nice that he provided a step by step guide. Unfortunately I did not have a second computer which is required to set up the management UI, so my experiment could not be accomplished lately.
