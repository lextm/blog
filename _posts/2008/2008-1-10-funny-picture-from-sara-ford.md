Sara's blog is quite fabulous, and the latest post contains a photo taken at CodeMash. While she sat behind the Microsoft table, you can see there was a CodeGear banner in the neighbour. Both of CodeGear and Microsoft are providing the best IDE products in the market and why cannot they be together?
