title: 'Custom Domain: Problem of Blogger? Picasa? Or Windows Live Writer?'
---
I have been using Windows Live Writer with Blogger. Therefore, all images are uploaded to my Picasa Web Albums.

Then comes this problem. When I configure my blog to use my custom domain, all images are lost. OMG, that's terrible.

OK. I give it up. Now when you navigate to http://lextm.cn or http://www.lextm.cn you will be redirected to http://lextm.blogspot.com so as to see all images I posted.

And now let me pray that someday this problem can be solved by someone.
