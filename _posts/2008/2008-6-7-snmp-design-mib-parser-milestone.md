title: '#SNMP Design: MIB Parser Milestone'
---
Just one minute earlier, the #SNMP MIB parser parsed all Net-SNMP bundled MIB documents except RFC1155-SMI.

I am going to parse this file later today so to close Work Item 2275. Therefore, keep an eye on #SNMP as I am going to make another build public soon.

Stay tuned.
