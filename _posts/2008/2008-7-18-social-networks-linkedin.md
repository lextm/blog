I had a Facebook account, but I rarely used it because I found out that I do not like the FB way of communication. I did not touch MySpace or others until I found LinkedIn on Marco Cantu's blog. Therefore, I keep updating my profile there and hope that some day an opportunity can reach me. It is always hard to find someone who knows my skills well.

By the way, if you have a LinkedIn profile and want some recommendation from me, leave me a message.
