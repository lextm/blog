---
I have written about Jexus in the past several times. Now I combine most of the posts to [a single Readme doc](https://github.com/jexuswebserver/jexus-contrib/blob/master/readme.en.md) on GitHub, and also write out [a release notes doc](https://github.com/jexuswebserver/jexus-contrib/blob/master/releasenotes.en.md) there.

I am going to write a new doc about IIS/Jexus feature by feature matrix to illustrate the similarity and differences between the two web servers designed for ASP.NET. Stay tuned.
