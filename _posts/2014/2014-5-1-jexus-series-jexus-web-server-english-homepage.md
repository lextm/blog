If you have followed this series, you already know what is Jexus, and gain some knowledge about it. Here I just want to remind you that [an English homepage](https://jexusmanager.com/) has been set up to host up-to-date contents regarding both Jexus web server and Jexus Manager at CodePlex.

We are going to provide more documentation when new releases of Jexus and Jexus Manager come. Stay tuned.
